# One-Sample Statistical Testing Tool (R)
This project provides a reusable R script for conducting **one-sample hypothesis tests** with full automation, assumption checks, visual diagnostics, and APA-style reporting. It is designed for use in **data science, athlete performance analysis, and research applications**.

---

## Features
- **Normality assessment** using the Shapiro-Wilk test and histogram
- **Automatic data transformation** (log, square root, inverse)
- **Best-fit transformation selection** based on Shapiro-Wilk p-values
- **Fallback to Wilcoxon signed-rank test** if transformations fail
- **Customizable test direction**: two-sided, greater, or less
- **Auto-calculation of mu_reference** (or user-defined)
- **APA-style reporting** (including tail direction and alpha level)
- **Faceted ggplot diagnostics** for all transformed variants
- **Auto-installs required packages**

---

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/one-sample-test-tool.git
2. Open the R script (one_sample_test.R) in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Run the script. The first block will automatically install and load all required packages.

---

## Dependencies
The script handles all required packages automatically:
- tidyverse
- broom
- car
- rstatix
- janitor

---

## Example Use Case
#Example test data
set.seed(123)
test_data <- tibble::tibble(
  subject_id = 1:30,
  test_metric = rnorm(30, mean = 57, sd = 5)
)

### The script will:
- Check for normality (Section 2A)
- Apply and evaluate transformations if needed (Section 2B)
- Run a one-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Section 3)
- Report APA-style results (Section 4)
- Display diagnostic plots
  
---

## Output Example
A one-sample t-test was conducted to compare jump height to the reference value of 55 (Î± = 0.05).
The log-transformed mean jump height (M = 4.01, SD = 0.10) was significantly greater than 55,
t(29) = 2.52, p = 0.018, 95% CI [3.97, 4.06].

---

## Customization
- You can edit these user-configurable parameters in Section 1 of the script:
- mu_reference: Population value to test against (optional; auto-calculated if omitted)
- tail_type: Direction of test ("two.sided", "greater", "less")
- alpha_level: Significance threshold (default = 0.05)
- metric_label: Friendly variable name used in output
You may also replace the simulated data section (1B) with your real dataset via CSV or direct assignment.
